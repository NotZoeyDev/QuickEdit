### QuickEdit
Simple app to split videos using FFMPEG.  
Probably filled with bugs, it just works.

### Usage
* You'll need ffmpeg added to your path.
* Most of the UI is controlled via key presses.
* Q will set the start time of the output video.
* E will set the end time of the output video.
* W will reload the app.
* S will render your video.
* C will open the concat window, shortcuts below.
* Left arrow will go to the previous frame.
* Right arrow will go to the next frame.
* Up arrow will go forward by one second.
* Down arrow will go backward by one second.

### Concat window
* Still requires ffmpeg.
* W will reset/clear the interface.
* A will let you add videos.
* D will concat your videos.
* Hovering on a video will play it silently.
* Pressing right or left while hovering on a video will let you change its position.
* Clicking on a video will remove it.

### Why
This is basically the easiest and fastest way to split a video without re-encoding, it's almost instant!
